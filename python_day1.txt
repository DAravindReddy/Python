    ch = c		(char)
    len	= 12.4		(float)

Data types:

1. integer:

In python if you want to give input from user we need to use input method
Eg: name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)

input is always string.
conver it into integer:
Eg: age = int(input("Enter your age: ")
print("Age = ",age)
